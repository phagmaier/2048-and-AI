okay what you are essentially going to do is do your
current thing of playing a bunch of games and then 
you'll write the board and then a newline and then the
move to be taken as recieved from our current shitty 
brute force solver 

and this will be your training data and once you have 
that so it's weights are at least somewhat decent you
can then do an iterative improvments thing where 
at each state of a game you can then check what would
happen on 100 random games using your current weights and 
taking this decision and if it turns out to be the best move
no update and then you can lower the weights of the others 
through gradient decent
