# 2048 AI

## DESCRIPTION
create 2048 and try to create an AI for the game. 
One of the problems I've always had with chess engines is 
that it is not what I think of when i think of AI since for 
the most part humans tell the machine what is valuable. I will 
begin with somewhat the same same strategy but i will hope to develop 
some form of self play with a dynamic algo that will learn what to value 
without any clue and then also give it the ability to dynamically update the values 
of just how important each of these things are. If all else fails i'll at least 
build a NN from scratch in c++ with a working crappy copy of 2048
