ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO IS TO JUST PARSE ALL TRAINING DATA USING THE FUNCTIONS I CREATED IN THE TRAINING
DATA DIRECTORY AND THEN WE'LL USE OUR HANDLE BUILT AUTO GRAD CLASS VAL AND CREATE A SIMPLE 
NEURAL NETWORK TRAINED ON THE DUMB SEARCH ALGORITHM AND THEN FROM THERE WE'LL BOOTSTRAP IT AND DO A SEARCH 
BASED ON OUR NEURAL NETWORK AND THEN TRAIN IT ON THAT
